# 🌾 Agricultural Loan Risk & Advisory System  
### Decision Support System for Agricultural Finance (B.Com Project)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Agricultural credit is a key pillar of rural development and farmer sustainability. However, loan stress and repayment issues often arise due to **income mismatch, excessive borrowing, credit discipline problems, and dependence on rainfed agriculture**.

The **Agricultural Loan Risk & Advisory System** is a **decision-support application** developed to analyze agricultural loan data and highlight **risk patterns**.  
The system focuses on **financial awareness and analytical understanding**, not on loan approval or rejection.

This project demonstrates how **commerce and finance concepts** can be supported using structured data and visual analysis.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The main objectives of this project are:

- To study **risk factors involved in agricultural lending**
- To analyze borrower profiles using structured loan data
- To present insights in a **simple and non-technical manner**
- To promote **responsible borrowing and financial awareness**
- To apply **B.Com concepts** using practical analytical tools

---

## 🧠 What the System Does

- Accepts agricultural loan data through CSV files  
- Classifies borrower profiles into:
  - 🟢 Low Risk  
  - 🟡 Medium Risk  
  - 🔴 High Risk  
- Displays **clear visual dashboards** for easy understanding
- Provides **general improvement suggestions** for risk awareness
- Generates **downloadable CSV and PDF summary reports**

> ⚠️ The system does **not** approve or reject loans.

---

## 📊 Key Insights Provided

The dashboard helps users understand:

- Overall loan risk distribution
- Credit score quality of borrowers
- Relationship between income and loan amount
- Crop-wise risk patterns
- Impact of irrigation type on loan risk
- Income distribution across risk categories

All insights are presented using **simple charts and labels**, suitable for non-technical users.

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

The project uses **synthetically generated agricultural loan data** created solely for learning and analysis.

### Data Fields Used:
- Farmer Age  
- Land Size (Acres)  
- Annual Farm Income  
- Loan Amount  
- Crop Type  
- Irrigation Type  
- Existing Loans  
- Credit Score  

Datasets of **10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 records** were used to test consistency and scalability.

---

## 🧾 Risk Classification Approach (Conceptual)

Risk categorization is based on commonly accepted agricultural finance considerations:

- Credit repayment discipline
- Loan amount in relation to income
- Size of landholding
- Existing loan burden
- Dependence on rainfed agriculture

This approach is **educational and indicative**, not regulatory.

---

## 🧭 Advisory & Awareness Support

For each borrower profile, the system provides **general improvement guidance**, such as:

- Maintaining responsible loan levels
- Improving credit discipline
- Reducing multiple loan exposure
- Exploring group-based lending options
- Considering irrigation support schemes

These suggestions are **informational only** and do not constitute financial advice.
